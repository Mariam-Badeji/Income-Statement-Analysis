## Executive Summary
### Overview of findings
Revenue generated from goods and services; includes $13,776,630 from sporting products, $2,817,000 from consultation/professional services, and $966,190 from other sources bringing total revenue to $17,559,820. Total expense comprised of COGS $6,711,500, OPEX $5,604,800, and interest & tax $929,400. Resulting in a total expense of $13,245,700.

### Insights
**Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**
COGS behavior exhibited significant variation throughout the year:
- COGS peaked in January at $662,600, yet the COGS % remained low due to strong sales performance.
- In contrast, September recorded the highest COGS % at 47.81%, despite having the lowest absolute COGS for the year, driven by weaker revenue.

**By business line:**
**Sport Equipment:**
- Highest COGS: $3,674,299
- Second lowest COGS %
- Revenue strength offsets high production/purchase costs, making it relatively efficient.

**Nutrition & Food Supplements:**
- COGS %: 55.18% (annual), peaking at 84.62% in April
- Indicates a low-margin product, costly to produce, and sensitive to revenue dips.

**Insight:**
Higher COGS % in lower-revenue months reflects declining cost efficiency. Strong sales volume plays a key role in maintaining healthy margins.

**Gross Profit Analysis**

Infocom achieved a gross profit of $10.85M with a gross margin of 61.78%, indicating strong pricing power and efficient production overall.
**Business line breakdown:**

**Sportwear:**

Gross profit: $4,787,700

Gross margin: 70.33%

Most profitable line, demonstrating highly efficient production and strong consumer demand.

Trend Observation:

Early-year decline in both gross profit and margin

Growth toward year-end

Suggests improved cost structure, stronger selling price strategy, or peak-season performance.

3.3 Operating Expenses (OPEX)

Total OPEX amounted to $5.64M, representing 31.92% of total revenue.
This indicates that for every $1 earned, Infocom spent $0.3192 on operating the business—an efficient and healthy cost profile.

Notable segment:

Nutrition & Food Supplements

OPEX: $1,395,200

OPEX Margin: 75.68%

Consumes a disproportionate share of revenue

Reflects poor cost leverage and weak revenue performance

Significant fixed costs amplify inefficiency when sales drop

Trend Observation:
OPEX % increases when absolute OPEX decreases, highlighting a negative correlation driven by lower revenue levels in specific months.

3.4 EBIT Performance

Infocom recorded an EBIT of $5.24M with a strong EBIT margin of 29.86%, demonstrating solid operational efficiency and the ability to convert nearly one-third of revenue into operating profit.

By business line:

Nutrition & Food Supplements posted a negative EBIT of -$568,880 (EBIT margin: -30.86%), indicating that its operating expenses significantly exceed its revenue, rendering the segment unprofitable.

3.5 Net Income

Infocom generated a net income of $4.31M, retaining 24.57% of its revenue as true profit after accounting for all expenses, interest, and taxes.
This strong bottom-line performance highlights:

disciplined expense management

efficient operations

a robust overall cost structure

4. Conclusion

The analysis of Infocom’s 2023 income statement reveals a company with strong overall financial performance, particularly in its Sportwear and Sport Inventory lines. These segments demonstrate high cost efficiency, strong margins, and consistent profitability.

However, the Nutrition & Food Supplements segment stands out as a significant area of concern. High COGS %, elevated OPEX %, and negative EBIT indicate that this segment is underperforming and may require:

cost restructuring,

pricing strategy review, or

product repositioning.

Overall, Infocom exhibits solid profitability, strong cost control, and healthy margins—positioning the company well for strategic growth and targeted improvements in weaker business lines.
